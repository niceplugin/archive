이 파트를 일고 나면 알게될 것들:

1. 일관된 코드 스타일을 갖는 것이 좋은 이유
2. Meteor에서 권장하는 JavaScript 코드 스타일
3. 자동 유효성 검사를 위한 ESLint 설정법
4. 메서드, 퍼블리케이션, 기타에서 Meteor의 특별한 스타일 패턴

# 일관된 스타일의 이점

수년 동안 수 많은 개발자들은 많은 시간을 들여 대괄호를 넣는 위치, 입력할 공백의 수, 큰따옴표 사용여부 등 여러 코드 스타일에 대해 질문하고 논의했습니다.
이것은 시각적인 코드 품질과 밀접한 관계가 있어 여러 의견이 많습니다.

사실 코드 내 문자열 리터럴에 대해 작은 또는 큰 따옴표를 사용하는 것에 대해서 어떤것을 쓰더라도 문제가 되지는 않습니다.
하지만 조직 내에서 어떠한 것을 사용할지 내린 결정을 짓고 이것을 유지하는 것은 코드를 유지보수하는데 큰 이점이 됩니다.
이러한 이점은 Meteor 및 JavaScript 개발 커뮤니티 전체에 적용됩니다.

## 읽기 쉬운 코드

한글(언어)문장을 한번에 한 단어씩 읽는 것이 아닌것처럼 코드도 한번에 한 토큰(역주: 예약어 단위의 단어급으로 생각)씩 읽으면서 해석하지는 않습니다.
일반적으로 특정 패턴이나 (텍스트)에디터에서 강조하는 스타일 방식을 보고 그 내용이 무엇일지 추측하게 됩니다.
코드를 들여쓰기 하는 것이 대표적인 예 입니다.
JavaScript에서 들여쓰기는 코드적인 의미는 없지만 모든 코드가 일관된 규칙대로 들여쓰기가 되어있으면 세부 사항을 모두 읽지 않아도 내용을 쉽게 유추할 수 있습니다.

```js
// 조건문 아래 두줄의 코드는 들여쓰기가 같은 위치이므로 둘 다 조건문 내에서 실행되는 코드라고 오해할 여지가 큽니다.
if (condition)
  firstStatement();
  secondStatement();
```

```js
// 훨씬 직관적입니다!
if (condition) {
  firstStatement();
}

secondStatement();
```

## Automatic error checking

Having a consistent style means that it's easier to adopt standard tools for error checking.
For example, if you adopt a convention that you must always use `let` or `const` instead of `var`, you can now use a tool to ensure all of your variables are scoped the way you expect.
That means you can avoid bugs where variables act in unexpected ways.
Also, by enforcing that all variables are declared before use, you can easily catch typos before even running any code!

## Deeper understanding

It's hard to learn everything about a programming language at once.
For example, programmers new to JavaScript often struggle with the `var` keyword and function scope.
Using a community-recommended coding style with automatic linting can warn you about these pitfalls proactively.
This means you can jump right into coding without learning about all of the edge cases of JavaScript ahead of time.

As you write more code and come up against the recommended style rules, you can take that as an opportunity to learn more about your programming language and how different people prefer to use it.

# JavaScript style guide

Here at Meteor, we strongly believe that JavaScript is the best language to build web applications, for a variety of reasons.
JavaScript is constantly improving, and the standards around ES2015 have really brought together the JavaScript community.
Here are our recommendations about how to use ES2015 JavaScript in your app today.

> An example of refactoring from JavaScript to ES2015

## Use the `ecmascript` package

ECMAScript, the language standard on which every browser's JavaScript implementation is based, has moved to yearly standards releases.
The newest complete standard is ES2015, which includes some long-awaited and very significant improvements to the JavaScript language.
Meteor's `ecmascript` package compiles this standard down to regular JavaScript that all browsers can understand using the [popular Babel compiler](https://babeljs.io/).
It's fully backwards compatible to "regular" JavaScript, so you don't have to use any new features if you don't want to.
We've put a lot of effort into making advanced browser features like source maps work great with this package, so that you can debug your code using your favorite developer tools without having to see any of the compiled output.

The `ecmascript` package is included in all new apps and packages by default, and compiles all files with the `.js` file extension automatically.
See the [list of all ES2015 features supported by the ecmascript package](https://docs.meteor.com/packages/ecmascript.html#Supported-ES2015-Features).

To get the full experience, you should also use the `es5-shim` package which is included in all new apps by default.
This means you can rely on runtime features like `Array#forEach` without worrying about which browsers support them.

All of the code samples in this guide and future Meteor tutorials will use all of the new ES2015 features.
You can also read more about ES2015 and how to get started with it on the Meteor Blog:

- [Set up Sublime Text for ES2015](http://info.meteor.com/blog/set-up-sublime-text-for-meteor-es6-es2015-and-jsx-syntax-and-linting)
- [How much does ES2015 cost?](http://info.meteor.com/blog/how-much-does-es2015-cost)

## Follow a JavaScript style guide

We recommend choosing and sticking to a JavaScript style guide and enforcing it with tools.
A popular option that we recommend is the [Airbnb style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) with the ES6 extensions (and optionally React extensions).

# Check your code with ESLint

"Code linting" is the process of automatically checking your code for common errors or style problems.
For example, ESLint can determine if you have made a typo in a variable name, or some part of your code is unreachable because of a poorly written `if` condition.

We recommend using the [Airbnb eslint configuration](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb) which verifies the Airbnb styleguide.

Below, you can find directions for setting up automatic linting at many different stages of development.
In general, you want to run the linter as often as possible, because it's the fastest and easiest way to identify typos and small errors.

## Installing and running ESLint

To setup ESLint in your application, you can install the following [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm) packages:

```
meteor npm install --save-dev babel-eslint eslint-config-airbnb eslint-plugin-import eslint-plugin-meteor eslint-plugin-react eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y eslint-import-resolver-meteor eslint @meteorjs/eslint-config-meteor
```

> Meteor comes with npm bundled so that you can type meteor npm without worrying about installing it yourself.
If you like, you can also use a globally installed npm command.

You can also add a `eslintConfig` section to your `package.json` to specify that you'd like to use the Airbnb config, and to enable [ESLint-plugin-Meteor](https://github.com/dferber90/eslint-plugin-meteor).
You can also setup any extra rules you want to change, as well as adding a lint npm command:

```
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "eslint .",
    "pretest": "npm run lint --silent"
  },
  "eslintConfig": {
    "extends": "@meteorjs/eslint-config-meteor"
  }
}
```

To run the linter, you can now simply type:

```bash
meteor npm run lint
```

For more details, read the [Getting Started](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started) directions from the ESLint website.

## Integrating with your editor

Linting is the fastest way to find potential bugs in your code.
Running a linter is usually faster than running your app or your unit tests, so it's a good idea to run it all the time.
Setting up linting in your editor can seem annoying at first since it will complain often when you save poorly-formatted code, but over time you'll develop the muscle memory to just write well-formatted code in the first place.
Here are some directions for setting up ESLint in different editors:


### Sublime Text

You can install the Sublime Text packages that integrate them into the text editor.
It's generally recommended to use Package Control to add these packages.
If you already have that setup, you can just add the these packages by name; if not, click the instructions links:

* Babel (for syntax highlighting – [full instructions](https://github.com/babel/babel-sublime#installation))
* SublimeLinter ([full instructions](http://sublimelinter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html))
* SublimeLinter-contrib-eslint ([full instructions](https://github.com/roadhump/SublimeLinter-eslint#plugin-installation))

To get proper syntax highlighting, go to a .js file, then select the following through the *View* dropdown menu: *Syntax* -> *Open all with current extension as...* -> *Babel* -> *JavaScript (Babel)*.
If you are using React .jsx files, do the same from a .jsx file.
If it's working, you will see "JavaScript (Babel)" in the lower right hand corner of the window when you are on one of these files.
Refer to the [package readme](https://github.com/babel/babel-sublime) for information on compatible color schemes.

A side note for Emmet users: You can use *\<ctrl-e\>* to expand HTML tags in .jsx files, and it will correctly expand classes to React's "className" property.
You can bind to the tab key for this, but [you may not want to](https://github.com/sergeche/emmet-sublime/issues/548).

### Atom

Using ESLint with Atom is simple.
Just install these three packages:

```bash
apm install language-babel
apm install linter
apm install linter-eslint
```

Then **restart** (or **reload** by pressing Ctrl+Alt+R / Cmd+Opt+R) Atom to activate linting.


### WebStorm

WebStorm provides [these instructions for using ESLint](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/help/eslint.html).
After you install the ESLint Node packages and set up your `package.json`, just enable ESLint and click "Apply".
You can configure how WebStorm should find your `.eslintrc` file, but on my machine it worked without any changes.
It also automatically suggested switching to "JSX Harmony" syntax highlighting.

![Enable ESLint here.](images/webstorm-configuration.png)

Linting can be activated on WebStorm on a project-by-project basis, or you can set ESLint as a default under Editor > Inspections, choosing the Default profile, checking "ESLint", and applying.

### Visual Studio Code

Using ESLint in VS Code requires installation of the 3rd party [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) extension.
 In order to install the extension, follow these steps:

1. Launch VS Code and open the quick open menu by typing `Ctrl+P`
2. Paste `ext install vscode-eslint` in the command window and press `Enter`
3. Restart VS Code


# Meteor code style

The section above talked about JavaScript code in general - you can easily apply it in any JavaScript application, not just with Meteor apps.
However, there are some style questions that are Meteor-specific, in particular how to name and structure all of the different components of your app.

## Collections

Collections should be named as a plural noun, in [PascalCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PascalCase).
The name of the collection in the database (the first argument to the collection constructor) should be the same as the name of the JavaScript symbol.

```js
// Defining a collection
Lists = new Mongo.Collection('lists');
```

Fields in the database should be camelCased just like your JavaScript variable names.

```js
// Inserting a document with camelCased field names
Widgets.insert({
  myFieldName: 'Hello, world!',
  otherFieldName: 'Goodbye.'
});
```

## Methods and publications

Method and publication names should be camelCased, and namespaced to the module they are in:

```js
// in imports/api/todos/methods.js
updateText = new ValidatedMethod({
  name: 'todos.updateText',
  // ...
});
```

Note that this code sample uses the [ValidatedMethod package recommended in the Methods article](methods.html#validated-method).
If you aren't using that package, you can use the name as the property passed to `Meteor.methods`.

Here's how this naming convention looks when applied to a publication:

```js
// Naming a publication
Meteor.publish('lists.public', function listsPublic() {
  // ...
});
```

## Files, exports, and packages

You should use the ES2015 `import` and `export` features to manage your code.
This will let you better understand the dependencies between different parts of your code, and it will be easy to know where to look if you need to read the source code of a dependency.

Each file in your app should represent one logical module.
Avoid having catch-all utility modules that export a variety of unrelated functions and symbols.
Often, this can mean that it's good to have one class, UI component, or collection per file, but there are cases where it is OK to make an exception, for example if you have a UI component with a small sub-component that isn't used outside of that file.

When a file represents a single class or UI component, the file should be named the same as the thing it defines, with the same capitalization.
So if you have a file that exports a class:

```js
export default class ClickCounter { ...
}
```

This class should be defined inside a file called `ClickCounter.js`.
When you import it, it'll look like this:

```js
import ClickCounter from './ClickCounter.js';
```

Note that imports use relative paths, and include the file extension at the end of the file name.

For [Atmosphere packages](using-packages.html), as the older pre-1.3 `api.export` syntax allowed more than one export per package, you'll tend to see non-default exports used for symbols.
For instance:

```js
// You'll need to destructure here, as Meteor could export more symbols
import { Meteor } from 'meteor/meteor';

// This will not work
import Meteor from 'meteor/meteor';
```

## Templates and components

Since Spacebars templates are always global, can't be imported and exported as modules, and need to have names that are completely unique across the whole app, we recommend naming your Blaze templates with the full path to the namespace, separated by underscores.
Underscores are a great choice in this case because then you can easily type the name of the template as one symbol in JavaScript.

```html
<template name="Lists_show">
  ...
</template>
```

If this template is a "smart" component that loads server data and accesses the router, append `_page` to the name:

```html
<template name="Lists_show_page">
  ...
</template>
```

Often when you are dealing with templates or UI components, you'll have several closely coupled files to manage.
They could be two or more of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
In this case, we recommend putting these together in the same directory with the same name:

```
# The Lists_show template from the Todos example app has 3 files:
show.html
show.js
show.less
```

The whole directory or path should indicate that these templates are related to the `Lists` module, so it's not necessary to reproduce that information in the file name.
Read more about directory structure [below](structure.html#javascript-structure).

If you are writing your UI in React, you don't need to use the underscore-split names because you can import and export your components using the JavaScript module system.
