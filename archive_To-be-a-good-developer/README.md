# To be a good developer

Who is a good developer?
Developers from good colleges?
A knowledgeable developer?
Developers from good companies?
Developers making a lot of money?

Here, let's learn the basics of becoming a developer with a good daily life based on the principle of the brain.
This is the [Learning How To Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) course,
This is a summary of what I needed the most as a developer.

The main topics are:

- Sleep
- Interleaving
- Focus and Diffuse mode of the brain

## Sleep

Sleep is more important than anything else.
If you think sleep is a waste of your life or time, you are wrong.
Sleep is like investing in the stock of learning development and life, which is always upward sloping.

The brain produces toxic substances just by being awake.
And while you're sleeping, the following happens:

- When you sleep, your brain cells get smaller and the space between them expands.
  At this time, the body fluid flows through the wide gap to remove toxins.
- Organize the concepts of the learned information, erase the less important parts of the memory, and reinforce the important parts.
- Helps the frontal lobe more easily interact with other parts of the brain to find solutions to what it learns.

So sleep is the easiest and best way to keep your brain clean and healthy.

## Interleaving

Learning by moving back and forth between different topics is called interleaving.
This is the first step to building creativity and flexibility in your brain.

Interleaving can further enhance the effect when going back and forth between different subjects or departments.

A good developer must be creative.
However, many developers study only the skills that are relevant to their job,
You will only have deep knowledge about that technology.
Then, unfortunately, you will always be replaced by a cheaper developer who is more knowledgeable than you.

You must develop a wide range of thinking and creativity to become a unique developer.

## Focus and Diffuse mode of the brain

The brain can only work in one of two modes:

- Focus Mode: Concentrates your thoughts and helps you come up with familiar thoughts. (when we are coding)
- Diffuse Mode: Use a free-thinking mindset. It is activated when you are in a resting state, such as walking, showering, or sleeping.

Developers sometimes face problems that no matter how much they think, they can't find a solution.
But the next day, when we meet again, there are cases where we find a solution without having to think about it.

The reason is that in diffuse mode, we unconsciously and unconsciously tried to solve our problems using free thinking.
(So we should get a good night's sleep and have a lot of tea time during work hours, even if the CEO hates it...)

Let's pass the parts that are difficult to find a solution to while coding.
And let's do other things we can do now.
Most of the coding that was not solved today will be solved like magic tomorrow.

## Conclusion

Our brains are more like children than we think.

- need frequent breaks
- It is good to be interested in a variety of subjects because of their curiosity.
- Immerse yourself in something, or fall into an imaginary land.

This will improve the developer's quality of life more than expected.
And with creative solutions and broad thinking, he is also well-received as a developer.
(In my case, yes.)

I hope this short article will help you in your life as a developer.
